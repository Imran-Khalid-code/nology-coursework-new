# Functioning Calculator Project

Hi there! Thanks for checking out my project:

During this project I gained a deeper understanding og how to interact with the DOM using function and developing my logic to enhance the user's experience.
As I progress during this course my aim is to refactor my code, in order to cut out any repeat code, thereby making it more readable and less likely to encounter bugs!
