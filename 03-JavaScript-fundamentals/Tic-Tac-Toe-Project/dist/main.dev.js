//need a function to randomly give X or O at the start of each game.
//when each player enters a button it takes it in and stores it 
//a function that stops you entering wrong key - if statement
// a function that stops the game as soon as there is three in a row
// a function that empty the board once we reach the end 
//need t0 add a default for to stop refresh in order to start a new game.
